HipCommit
=========

Commits and build updates go from Atlassian FishEye and Bamboo to HipChat.

Configuring HipCommit
---------------------

Create a file named ``constants.py``. Start reverse-engineering. I'm sorry.

This will obviously be replaced with configparser in the future. Just need to
separate the logic from the hunter2.

About the name
--------------

It's temporary. Other ideas were worse:

* HipEye
* HipFish
* CommitBot
* Commits

Its name will probably end up being Unofficial Atlassian Integrations for
HipChat, or Unatinfohip.
