HipCommit
=========

Commits and build updates go from Atlassian FishEye and Bamboo to HipChat.

Currently only compatible with JIRA Studio. For all I know, it's only compatible with my specific instance of JIRA Studio. I'm sorry.

Configuring HipCommit
---------------------

Create a copy of ``sample_config.ini`` named ``config.ini`` and replace these values with sensible ones from your setup.

About the name
--------------

It's temporary. Other ideas were worse:

* HipEye
* HipFish
* CommitBot
* Commits
* Unofatinfohich (Unofficial Atlassian Integrations for HipChat)

Its name will probably end up being JIRA Studio Integrations for HipChat, or Jistinfohich.
